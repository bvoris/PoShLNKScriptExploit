# PoShLNKScriptExploit

This isn't new and is continued to be leveraged by threat actors across the globe.
I'll demonstrate why LNK files should be blocked at the email level and if embedded in other files should be blocked by default.

We'll take a single line from an LNK file that executes PowerShell:
%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe



We will add the following:
-NoExit
-NoExit Prevents the window from exiting once the commands have been run

-c 
-c executes commands directly following the -c

Now we can add ANY powerShell that can fit in the 255 character limit.



%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoExit -c 1..5 | foreach { write-host "." -NoNewline; sleep -sec 1} -end {write-host "Formatting C Drive Complete!" }
